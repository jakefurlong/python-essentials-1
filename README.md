# Python Essentials 1

This repo represents the hands-on labs that will best prepare you for the Python Institute certification - Python Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (PCEP-30-XX). This certification is the first foundational knowledge base that leads to all other Python Institute certifications in the areas of General-Purpose Programming, Data Science, Testing, Security, Network Programming, and Web Development. I recommend mastering these exercises in conjunction with the Anki deck I made for flashcards. You can find my Anki deck at https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/284603792?cb=1703262891676
